# Logo Design and Animation

This project showcases a personal logo design and animation created using React and Framer Motion. The animation includes three distinct variations, each highlighting different aspects of the design and movement. The animations are purely for personal use and are intended to demonstrate creative skills in both design and animation.

## Overview

The logo is brought to life with smooth and interactive animations crafted using the powerful animation library, Framer Motion, integrated within a React application. Each animation variation presents a unique style and flow, reflecting different moods and themes. This project serves as a personal exploration of dynamic logo design, focusing on creativity and motion design techniques.

### Animation Variations

1. **Variation One**: First try that has the outer rings swivel in and out reactive to the outer hexagon.
2. **Variation Two**: the full vision of the animation where the notches on the outer hexagon light up the outer rings.
3. **Variation Three**: Minimalistic performance based, the outer rings are not very smooth, so I decided to not animate them in this variation and you can tell why.

### Technology Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to structure and manage the components of the logo and animations.
- **Framer Motion**: An open-source motion library for React, used to create and control the various animations with precision and fluidity.
